"""A named, orderable block of ReportRow destined for one report sheet —
ported from clsReportSection.cls.

Pure data, no Worksheet/Range dependency. Built by a section-builder class
per block type (e.g. a metals-panel builder); written by a report writer
that stays VBA-side (see this repo's README) — the only thing that touches
Excel. One ReportSection instance IS the content a VBA named range used to
represent, but as inspectable data instead of hidden Excel state.
