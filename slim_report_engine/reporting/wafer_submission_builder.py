"""Groups a Wafer TRSubmission's sample rows onto physical sheets and
builds each sheet's content — the piece the legacy macro's
Wafer_Blank_Report_Creator called grouping/dispatch, ported here as pure
Transform-stage logic operating on already-parsed TRSample data instead
of directly reading Excel cells.

A wafer's grouping identity is (Reporting Units, Wafer Size, resolved
Element/Anion selection, Processing Time) — confirmed real per
DOMAIN_BRIEF.md's Wafer section. Multiple physical sample rows sharing all
four values land on ONE sheet, one column per sample (see
wafer_report_builder.build_wafer_sheet). Grouping preserves the
submission's own sample order (TR-row order).

ELEMENT-COUNT NORMALIZATION: "10 Elements"/"26 Elements" render
byte-identical content to "36 Elements" on a Wafer sheet — confirmed
against the real form's own dropdown and against wafer_panel_builder
itself: unlike Chemical/Water's metals panel, a Wafer element panel has
no AVERAGE/TOTAL summary label, so there's nothing for these three
selections to differ on at all. Normalized to "36 Elements" for both the
group key and the content dispatch.

ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS: each sample row can independently request its own
"Additional Elements", but one sheet has one shared panel. Per explicit
direction: add the UNION of every sample's additional elements to the
shared sheet, and let the technician leave irrelevant cells blank for a
blank report — not one panel per sample.

CUSTOMER: uses the resolved Customer.name (the canonical property), not
the raw form_customer_name — needed for the sample-ID string's
substitution rules (e.g. UPS -> FUJIFILM UPS) to fire correctly.
