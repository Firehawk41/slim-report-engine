"""Builds a ReportSection for the Anions/Cations/GBP panel shape — ported
from clsIonListSectionBuilder.cls. Shares the header/row/footer shape with
the metals panels (see row_builders) but differs in that:

- ions aren't DB-backed at all (no "add a new anion" business process the
  way there is for chemicals/customers — fixed reference data, see
  presets/ion_presets.py), so this takes ready-made Analyte objects
  directly and has no element-service dependency;
- the third results column is labeled "QL", not "MDL" (confirmed from the
  real template);
- there is NO AVERAGE/TOTAL summary — confirmed from the real template,
  the block ends directly at the "Analysis by IC" footer.
