"""Real per-column widths (points) for each report family, confirmed via
openpyxl against each family's own real template. Plain data, no openpyxl
dependency, so the Transform-stage orchestrators (submission_report_builder,
dm5_non_routine_report_builder) can attach the right preset to an
OutputSheet without pulling in a Worksheet dependency -- only
report_writer.apply_column_widths (Write stage) actually touches a
Worksheet with these values.

Column widths are a sheet-wide Excel property, not a per-row one, which is
why these live here as one dict per family rather than per row/style.
Columns not listed are left at Excel's own default; the real templates
themselves don't customize them consistently either.
